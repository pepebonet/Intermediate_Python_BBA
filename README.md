# Intermediate_Python_BBA

Intermediate level Python course for Business students at Esade. Have you heard of Artificial Intelligence (AI) recently? In the world that we are living, some companies are starting to make some, if not most, of their business decisions based on analyzing their data. They are becoming what is called Data-Driven. However, what is the background of all of it? It is computer programming and, in many cases, the programming language employed is Python. Therefore, a better understanding of Python programming and data processing automation is becoming an essential skill in the future for any professional.

# Course Goals and Objectives

The skills the student will acquire while taking this course can be summarized as follows:

• Understand the framework and relevance of programming in today's world, as well as the impact of AI

• Grasp the benefits and scope of programming in a Data-Driven world and of Python in particular.

• Improve knowledge of programming structures, tools, libraries, best practices, and data manipulation
using Python.

• Acquire expertise in data exploration, its analysis, and the extraction of valuable information

• Application of simple AI tools to extract predictive value from data.

# Syllabus

- Relevance of programming in the current world. The latest AI applications. Impact of AI in a variety of fields.

- Consolidation of Python fundamentals for data analysis: Pandas, NumPy, Functions, Data Structures, Matplotlib

- Understanding your data with Python: Application of previous concepts to cleaning, transforming and getting value from your data. ETL process & Data Visualization

- Employ simple AI tools to get additional value from your data

- Possibility to go beyond: Python Classes, Python best practices, Collections, Comprehensions, Exceptions, and more

This is a hands-on course. Students are expected to participate actively during class and practice exercises

# Course Grading

This course is based on a participative methodology.
• Active participation and class attendance represent 60% of the course grade. 10 % Attendance - 50 % coding the exercises and uploading the document after every session to the Moodle.
• The final project will account for 40% of the course grade. You must complete a report using a Jupyter Notebook (or python script) in either a provided dataset or an open-source one and apply the different topics learned in class, explaining the steps taken. Moreover, you have to complete a 2-page report of your results, summarizing the results and the value extracted from data, and possible applications of AI you could see applying to such a dataset. You will need to upload both to the Moodle max two weeks after the last lecture.

# Installation
## Clone repository
If you want to make use of all the materials, cloning the code to your local or downloading it would be the best. In order to do so:

    git clone git@github.com:pepebonet/Intermediate_Python_BBA.git

## Install dependencies
We highly recommend to use a virtual environment to work with the code, as additional packages may need to be downloaded as you keep coding. To do so:

`Create environment:`

    conda create --name python_inter python=3.8
    conda activate python_inter

From there the only packages that are needed are `pandas` and `numpy` for now and that jupyter notebooks can be run.
